## Tools
- MySQL Workbench - Data Cleaning and Analysis [Download Here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
- Microsoft Power BI - Data Visualization [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com/)

## Data Cleaning
In this phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Imported the Data into MySQL Workbench using the Import Table Wizard
2. Checked for null values and duplicate records, ensuring data quality
3. Standardized the data for consistency and analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis
I used SQL to conduct the following analyses on the data:

**1.	Customer Behavior Analysis**
- How many distinct customers are there?
- What is the overall distribution of customer ages in the dataset?
- Which gender has the highest total sales amount?
- Which age category has the highest number of purchases and total sales?
- How does the frequency of purchases vary across different age categories?
- What is the most common to least common interval between purchases?
- Are there any specific colors that are more popular among customers?
- What are the number of customers that purchased with a subscription vs. without?
- How many subscribed customers use discounts vs unsubscribed?

**2.	Product Performance Analysis**
- How many distinct items and categories are sold?
- How does the average purchase amount vary across different product categories?
- Which category has the most number of purchases and total sales?
- What are the most commonly purchased items in each category?
- Are there any correlations between the size of the product and the purchase amount?
- Which shipping type is preferred by customers for different product categories?
- What are the top 5 and bottom 5 product category & Items based on average ratings?
- What are the General Category Average Ratings?

**3.	Sales and Marketing Anaysis**
- Which season has the most number of purchases and Total Sales?
- What are the seasonal sales by category?
- Are there any noticeable differences in purchase behavior between different locations?
- Which payment method is the most popular among customers?

- Do customers who use promo codes tend to spend more than those who don't?
- What is the popularity of shipping types & Impact on sales?
- How does the presence of a discount influence the purchase decision of male and female customers?

Below are some of the SQL queries executed to extract insights from the data:
- This SQL query returns the most commonly purchased items in each category
```sql
WITH CTE_rank AS
(
SELECT Item_Purchased, Category, COUNT(Item_Purchased) AS Item_count, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Category ORDER BY COUNT(Item_Purchased) DESC) AS row_num
FROM sales_info
GROUP BY Item_Purchased, Category
)
SELECT Item_Purchased, Category, Item_count, row_num
FROM CTE_rank
WHERE row_num = 1;
```
- This SQL query returns the frequency of purchases across different age groups
```sql
SELECT Age_Category, SUM(CASE WHEN FrequencyOf_Purchases = 'Weekly' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Weekly_Customers,
                     SUM(CASE WHEN FrequencyOf_Purchases = 'Bi-Weekly' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Bi_Weekly_Customers,
                     SUM(CASE WHEN FrequencyOf_Purchases = 'Fortnightly' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Fortnightly_Customers,
                     SUM(CASE WHEN FrequencyOf_Purchases = 'Quarterly' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Quarterly_Customers,
                     SUM(CASE WHEN FrequencyOf_Purchases = 'Every 3 Months' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Every_3_Months_Customers,
                     SUM(CASE WHEN FrequencyOf_Purchases = 'Annually' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Annual_Customers
FROM sales_info
GROUP BY Age_Category
ORDER BY Weekly_Customers DESC ;
```
